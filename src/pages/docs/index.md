# About Typesaurus

Typesaurus is the TypeScript-first ODM for Firestore.

**Why?**

- Designed with TypeScript's type inference in mind
- Universal code (browser & Node.js)
- Uncompromised type-safety
- Code autocomplete
- Say goodbye to any!
- Say goodbye to exceptions!

- [Ready to start? Follow this guide](/docs/intro/quickstart).

## Features

- **Universal package**: reuse the same code on client and server.
- **JavaScript-native**: converts Firestore data types, i.e. timestamp, to native JS types, i.e. `Date`.
- **Build size-efficiency**: optimized build-size for web.
- **Advanced type-safety**: uncompromised type-safety, includes Firestore quirks.
- **Typed ids**: all document ids are types, so you'll never mix up a user id with an account id.
- **Centralized schema**: easy to define, read and update.
- **Single-import principle**: single import to define, single import to use.
